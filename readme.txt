Invoice Management Program

Description
This C++ program manages invoice data, allowing the user to input and display information for multiple parts of an invoice.

Features
-   Takes part number, part name/description, quantity, and price per item as input.
-   Stores and displays invoice details for multiple parts.
-   Utilizes a class to represent an invoice.
-   Demonstrates the use of getters and setters to access and modify invoice information.

Code Structure
The code consists of three files:

-   `main.cpp` (f.txt): Contains the main function, which handles user input for multiple parts and displays their details.
-   `invoice.cpp` (e.txt): Contains the implementation of the Invoice class methods (constructor, getters, and setters).
-   `header.h` (d.txt): Contains the declaration of the Invoice class.

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations.
-   string: For handling string data (part descriptions).

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the files with a .cpp extension (e.g., main.cpp, invoice.cpp, header.cpp) and use a C++ compiler.
